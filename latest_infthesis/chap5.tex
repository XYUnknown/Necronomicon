The bird with the thorn in its breast, it follows an immutable law; it is driven by it knows not what to impale itself, and die singing. At the very instant the thorn enters there is no awareness in it of the dying to come; it simply sings and sings until there is not the life left to utter another note. But we, when we put the thorns in our breasts, we know. We understand. And still we do it. Still we do it.\\

\lettrine{T}{hroughout} this manuscript, three conceptual questions have been addressed via three studies presented in chapter~\ref{chap2}, chapter~\ref{chap3}, and chapter~\ref{chap4}, ultimately, they all relate to the fundamental motivation of my researches concerning the meaning of computer programs --- to design better abstraction for modelling and understanding programs as well as better formal frameworks for reasoning about programs.

The study discussed in chapter~\ref{chap2} is conducted to address the first conceptual question: How to design a better abstraction mechanism that allows programmers to effectively express \emph{what} they want a computer to do via some declarative yet accurate \emph{specifications} instead of \emph{how} a computer should accomplish a task via some concrete \emph{implementations}?

The study discussed in chapter~\ref{chap3} is conducted to address the second conceptual question: How to intuitively understand \emph{distributed programs} using the same conceptual model as \emph{monolithic programs}?

The study discussed in chapter~\ref{chap4} is conducted to adress the third conceptual question: How do we characterise the relationship between the \emph{syntax} and \emph{semantics} of programming languages?

Everything beautiful will eventually come to an end. Like the bird with the impaling thorn, although I have been asking different questions, wondering around different paths, searching for different angles to gain some understandings of the questions I have been asking, they all eventually lead to the same direction: I am in the process of searching for the meaning of the world, especially the world of which I am the centre --- and in the end the result might just be: \emph{It is meaningless}. Nevertheless, I know, I understand, even if there is nothing there, still I search for it, till the end of my life, still I search for it.


% - FIN -

% Till the end of this journey, instead of proudly announcing that I have provided an answer stating how significant the works have been done which contribute to designing better programming languages and having better reasoning frameworks for programming languages, I find myself still in the process of modelling, assigning, questioning and understanding the \emph{meaning} of computer programs. It has already become a small yet important part of my journey of searching for the meaning of the world, especially the world of which I am the centre --- and in the end the result might just be \emph{it is meaningless}. However, I understand, even if there is nothing there, still I search for it, till the end of my life, still I search for it.
