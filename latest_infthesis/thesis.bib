Words are not mere bundles of semantic features but, rather, are structured and active participants in the grammatical and compositional operations inherent in language. The principal areas of concern to this end are ambiguity and polysemy, the semantic relation between words and the types they denote, and the mapping to syntax from semantic forms. Lexical semantics is both the interface between conceptualization and language and the building block for compositional semantics.}

Leonard Talmy approaches the question of how language organizes conceptual material both at a general level and by analyzing a crucial set of particular conceptual domains: space and time, motion and location, causation and force interaction, and attention and viewpoint. Talmy maintains that these are among the most fundamental parameters by which language structures conception.

abstract = {Conceptual integration—“blending”—is a general cognitive operation on a par with analogy, recursion, mental modeling, conceptual categorization, and framing. It serves a variety of cognitive purposes. It is dynamic, supple, and active in the moment of thinking. It yields products that frequently become entrenched in conceptual structure and grammar, and it often performs new work on its previously entrenched products as inputs. Blending is easy to detect in spectacular cases but it is for the most part a routine, workaday process that escapes detection except on technical analysis. It is not reserved for special purposes, and is not costly. In blending, structure from input mental spaces is projected to a separate, “blended” mental space. The projection is selective. Through completion and elaboration, the blend develops structure not provided by the inputs. Inferences, arguments, and ideas developed in the blend can have effect in cognition, leading us to modify the initial inputs and to change our view of the corresponding situations. Blending operates according to a set of uniform structural and dynamic principles. It additionally observes a set of optimality principles.},

    abstract = "{This book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty. In this book Mark Steedman argues that the surface syntax of natural languages maps spoken and written forms directly to a compositional semantic representation that includes predicate-argument structure, quantification, and information structure without constructing any intervening structural representation. His purpose is to construct a principled theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both explanatory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto representations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody, and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed. This property allows Combinatory Categorial Grammar to capture elegantly the structure and interpretation of coordination and intonation contour in English as well as some well-known interactions between word order, coordination, and relativization across a number of other languages. It also allows more direct compatibility with incremental semantic interpretation during parsing.The book covers topics in formal linguistics, intonational phonology, computational linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics, presenting them as an integrated theory of the language faculty in a form accessible to readers from any of those fields.}",

The study of type systems--and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective -- -has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security. This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material. The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.}},

abstract = {SMT-based checking of refinement types for call-by-value languages is a well-studied subject. Unfortunately, the classical translation of refinement types to verification conditions is unsound under lazy evaluation. When checking an expression, such systems implicitly assume that all the free variables in the expression are bound to values. This property is trivially guaranteed by eager, but does not hold under lazy, evaluation. Thus, to be sound and precise, a refinement type system for Haskell and the corresponding verification conditions must take into account which subset of binders actually reduces to values. We present a stratified type system that labels binders as potentially diverging or not, and that (circularly) uses refinement types to verify the labeling. We have implemented our system in LIQUIDHASKELL and present an experimental evaluation of our approach on more than 10,000 lines of widely used Haskell libraries. We show that LIQUIDHASKELL is able to prove 96\% of all recursive functions terminating, while requiring a modest 1.7 lines of termination-annotations per 100 lines of code.

abstract = {The aim of this work is largely a practical one. A widely employed style of programming, particularly in structure-processing languages which impose no discipline of types, entails defining procedures which work well on objects of a wide variety. We present a formal type discipline for such polymorphic procedures in the context of a simple programming language, and a compile time type-checking algorithm W which enforces the discipline. A Semantic Soundness Theorem (based on a formal semantics for the language) states that well-type programs cannot ``go wrong” and a Syntactic Soundness Theorem states that if W accepts a program then it is well typed. We also discuss extending these results to richer languages; a type-checking algorithm based on W is in fact already implemented and working, for the metalanguage ML in the Edinburgh LCF system.}

abstract = {Solver-aided domain-specific languages (SDSLs) are an emerging class of computer-aided programming systems. They ease the construction of programs by using satisfiability solvers to automate tasks such as verification, debugging, synthesis, and non-deterministic execution. But reducing programming tasks to satisfiability problems involves translating programs to logical constraints, which is an engineering challenge even for domain-specific languages.We have previously shown that translation to constraints can be avoided if SDSLs are implemented by (traditional) embedding into a host language that is itself solver-aided. This paper describes how to implement a symbolic virtual machine (SVM) for such a host language. Our symbolic virtual machine is lightweight because it compiles to constraints only a small subset of the host's constructs, while allowing SDSL designers to use the entire language, including constructs for DSL embedding. This lightweight compilation employs a novel symbolic execution technique with two key properties: it produces compact encodings, and it enables concrete evaluation to strip away host constructs that are outside the subset compilable to constraints. Our symbolic virtual machine architecture is at the heart of Rosette, a solver-aided language that is host to several new SDSLs.},

abstract = {Solver-aided domain-specific languages (SDSLs) are an emerging class of computer-aided programming systems. They ease the construction of programs by using satisfiability solvers to automate tasks such as verification, debugging, synthesis, and non-deterministic execution. But reducing programming tasks to satisfiability problems involves translating programs to logical constraints, which is an engineering challenge even for domain-specific languages.We have previously shown that translation to constraints can be avoided if SDSLs are implemented by (traditional) embedding into a host language that is itself solver-aided. This paper describes how to implement a symbolic virtual machine (SVM) for such a host language. Our symbolic virtual machine is lightweight because it compiles to constraints only a small subset of the host's constructs, while allowing SDSL designers to use the entire language, including constructs for DSL embedding. This lightweight compilation employs a novel symbolic execution technique with two key properties: it produces compact encodings, and it enables concrete evaluation to strip away host constructs that are outside the subset compilable to constraints. Our symbolic virtual machine architecture is at the heart of Rosette, a solver-aided language that is host to several new SDSLs.},

Our core calculus can express a rich variety of typing idioms; for example, intersection, union, negation, singleton, nullable, variant, and algebraic types are all derivable. We formulate a semantics in which expressions denote terms, and types are interpreted as first-order logic formulas. Subtyping is defined as valid implication between the semantics of types. The formulas are interpreted in a specific model that we axiomatize using standard first-order theories. On this basis, we present a novel type-checking algorithm able to eliminate many dynamic tests and to detect many errors statically. The key idea is to rely on an SMT solver to compute subtyping efficiently. Moreover, interpreting types as formulas allows us to call the SMT solver at run-time to compute instances of types.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming}, pages = {105–116}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {type systems, semantic subtyping, data processing, satisfiability modulo theories}, location = {Baltimore, Maryland, USA}, series = {ICFP '10} }

This is the undisputed go-to guide to Rust, written by two members of the Rust core team, with feedback and contributions from 42 members of the community. The book assumes that youve written code in another programming language but makes no assumptions about which one, meaning the material is accessible and useful to developers from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. Known by the Rust community as The Book, The Rust Programming Language includes concept chapters, where youll learn about a particular aspect of Rust, and project chapters, where youll apply what youve learned so far to build small programs. The Book opens with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Next come detailed explanations of Rust-oriented perspectives on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers, with concrete examples and exercises--taking you from theory to practice. The Rust Programming Language will also show you how to:- Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes- Use Cargo, Rusts built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code, including downloading and building dependencies- Effectively use Rusts zero-cost abstractions and employ your own Youll learn to develop reliable code thats speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level. When you need to dive down into lower-level control, this guide will show you how without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes and without requiring you to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain. Youll also learn how to create command line programs, build single- and multithreaded web servers, and much more. The Rust Programming Language fully embraces Rusts potential to empower its users. This friendly and approachable guide will help you build not only your knowledge of Rust but also your ability to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains.} }

@phdthesis{10.5555/910306, author = {Nelson, Bruce Jay}, title = {Remote procedure call}, year = {1981}, publisher = {Carnegie Mellon University}, address = {USA}, abstract = {Remote procedure call is the synchronous language-level transfer of control between programs in disjoint address spaces whose primary communication medium is a narrow channel. The thesis of this dissertation is that remote procedure call (RPC) is a satisfactory and efficient programming language primitive for constructing distributed systems. A survey of existing remote procedure mechanisms shows that past RPC efforts are weak in addressing the five crucial issues: uniform call semantics, binding and configuration, strong typechecking, parameter functionality, and concurrency and exception control. The body of the dissertation elaborates these issues and defines a set of corresponding essential properties for RPC mechanisms. These properties must be satisfied by any RPC mechanism that is fully and uniformly integrated into a programming language for a homogeneous distributed system. Uniform integration is necessary to meet the dissertation's fundamental goal of syntactic and semantic transparency for local and remote procedures. Transparency is important so that programmers need not concern themselves with the physical distribution of their programs.In addition to these essential language properties, a number of pleasant properties are introduced that ease the work of distributed programming. These pleasant properties are good performance, sound remote interface design, atomic transactions, respect for autonomy, type translation, and remote debugging.With the essential and pleasant properties broadly explored, the detailed design of an RPC mechanism that satisfies all of the essential properties and the performance property is presented. Two design approaches are used: The first assumes full programming language support and involves changes to the language's compiler and binder. The second involves no language changes, but uses a separate translator--a source-to-source RPC compiler--to implement the same functionality.Design decisions crucial to the efficiency of the mechanism are made using a set of RPC performance lessons. These lessons are based on the empirical performance evaluation of a sequence of five working RPC mechanisms, each one faster than its predecessor. Some expected results about the costs of parameter copying, process switching, and runtime type manipulation are confirmed; a surprising result about the price of protocol layering is presented as well. These performance lessons, applied in concert, reduce the roundtrip time for a remote procedure call by a remarkable factor of 35. For moderate speed personal computers communicating over an Ethernet, for example, a simple remote call takes 800 microseconds; on a higher speed personal computer, the same remote call takes 149 microseconds. In both cases the remote call takes about 20 times longer than the same local call. This represents a substantial performance improvement over other operational RPC mechanisms.}, note = {AAI8204168} }

abstract = {We show a distributed object model for the JavaTM System [1,6] (hereafter referred to simply as "Java") that retains as much of the semantics of the Java object model as possible, and only includes differences where they make sense for distributed objects. The distributed object system is simple, in that a) distributed objects are easy to use and to implement, and b) the system itself is easily extensible and maintainable. We have designed such a model and implemented a system that supports remote method invocation (RMI) for distributed objects in Java. This system combines aspects of both the Modula-3 Network Objects system [3] and Spring's subcontract [8] and includes some novel features.To achieve its goal of seamless integration in the language, the system exploits the use of pickling [14] to transmit arguments and return values and also exploits unique features of Java in order to dynamically load stub code to clients. The final system will include distributed reference-counting garbage collection for distributed objects as well as lazy activation [11,16].},

Our starting point is the classic Krivine machine, which implements reduction for untyped call-by-name PCF. We successively add the features that we need for distributed execution and show the correctness of each addition. Then we construct a two-level operational semantics, where the high level is a network of communicating machines, and the low level is given by local machine transitions. Using these networks, we arrive at our final system, the Krivine Net. We show that Krivine Nets give a correct distributed implementation of the Krivine machine, which preserves both termination and non-termination properties. All the technical results have been formalised and proved correct in Agda.

A thread can only mutate (allocate, deallocate) objects within one active region---its "window of mutability". Memory management costs are localised to the active region, ensuring overheads can be predicted and controlled. Moving the mutability window between regions is explicit, so code can be executed wherever it is required, yet programs remain in control of memory use. An ownership type system based on reference capabilities enforces region isolation, controlling aliasing within and between regions, yet supporting objects moving between regions and threads. Data accesses never need expensive atomic operations, and are always thread-safe.}, journal = {Proc. ACM Program.

abstract = {ORCA is a concurrent and parallel garbage collector for actor programs, which does not require any STW steps, or synchronization mechanisms, and that has been designed to support zero-copy message passing and sharing of mutable data. ORCA is part of a runtime for actor-based languages, which was co-designed with the Pony programming language, and in particular, with its data race free type system. By co-designing an actor language with its runtime, it was possible to exploit certain language properties in order to optimize performance of garbage collection. Namely, ORCA relies on the guarantees of absence of race conditions in order to avoid read/write barriers, and it leverages the actor message passing, for synchronization among actors.  In this paper we briefly describe Pony and its type system. We use pseudo-code in order to introduce how ORCA allocates and deallocates objects, how it shares mutable data without requiring barriers upon data mutation, and how can immutability be used to further optimize garbage collection. Moreover, we discuss the advantages of co-designing an actor language with its runtime, and we demonstrate that ORCA can be implemented in a performant and scalable way through a set of micro-benchmarks, including a comparison with other well-known collectors.},

abstract = {High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2--4\texttimes{} with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.},

This paper develops a weakest precondition logic for reasoning about strategies programmed in the strategy language Stratego.

Its use is illustrated by characterizing properties of several reduction strategies for the lambda calculus with explicit substitutions.},

	abstract = {System S is a calculus providing the basic abstractions of term rewriting: matching and building terms, term traversal, combining computations and handling failure. The calculus forms a core language for implementation of a wide variety of rewriting languages, or more generally, languages for specifying tree transformations. In this paper we show how a conventional rewriting language based on conditional term rewriting can be implemented straightforwardly in System S. Subsequently we show how this implementation can be extended with features such as matching conditions, negative conditions, default rules, non-strictness annotations and alternative evaluation strategies. We thank Bas Luttik and Andrew Tolmach for many discussions on rewriting strategies and their applications. Jan Bergstra pointed out the problems of non-determinism and conditional rules in languages such as ASF+SDF. Eu-genio Moggi made clear that our semantics does not model programs with global backtracking, but rather local backtracking, which was what we were looking for.},

	abstract = {Program transformation is used in many areas of software engineering. Examples include compilation, optimization, synthesis, refactoring, migration, normalization and improvement [15]. Rewrite rules are a natural formalism for expressing single program transformations. However, using a standard strategy for normalizing a program with a set of rewrite rules is not adequate for implementing program transformation systems. It may be necessary to apply a rule only in some phase of a transformation, to apply rules in some order, or to apply a rule only to part of a program. These restrictions may be necessary to avoid non-termination or to choose a specific path in a non-con uent rewrite system.},

abstract = {This paper provides a unifying axiomatic account of the interpretation of recursive types that incorporates both domain-theoretic and realizability models as concrete instances. Our approach is to view such models as full subcategories of categorical models of intuitionistic set theory. It is shown that the existence of solutions to recursive domain equations depends upon the strength of the set theory. We observe that the internal set theory of an elementary topos is not strong enough to guarantee their existence. In contrast, as our first main result, we establish that solutions to recursive domain equations do exist when the category of sets is a model of full intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. We then apply this result to obtain a denotational interpretation of FPC, a recursively typed lambda-calculus with call-by-value operational semantics. By exploiting the intuitionistic logic of the ambient model of intuitionistic set theory, we analyse the relationship between operational and denotational semantics. We first prove an “internal” computational adequacy theorem: the model always believes that the operational and denotational notions of termination agree. This allows us to identify, as our second main result, a necessary and sufficient condition for genuine “external” computational adequacy to hold, i.e. for the operational and denotational notions of termination to coincide in the real world. The condition is formulated as a simple property of the internal logic, related to the logical notion of 1-consistency. We provide useful sufficient conditions for establishing that the logical property holds in practice. Finally, we outline how the methods of the paper may be applied to concrete models of FPC. In doing so, we obtain computational adequacy results for an extensive range of realizability and domain-theoretic models.}

abstract="Moggi proposed a monadic account of computational effects. He also presented the computational $\lambda$-calculus, $\lambda$c, a core call-by-value functional programming language for effects; the effects are obtained by adding appropriate operations. The question arises as to whether one can give a corresponding treatment of operational semantics. We do this in the case of algebraic effects where the operations are given by a single-sorted algebraic signature, and their semantics is supported by the monad, in a certain sense. We consider call-by-value PCF with--- and without---recursion, an extension of $\lambda$cwith arithmetic. We prove general adequacy theorems, and illustrate these with two examples: non-determinism and probabilistic nondeterminism.",

We formalize the connections between the coinductive big-step semantics and the standard small-step semantics, proving that both semantics are equivalent. We then study the use of coinductive big-step semantics in proofs of type soundness and proofs of semantic preservation for compilers. A methodological originality of this paper is that all results have been proved using the Coq proof assistant. We explain the proof-theoretic presentation of coinductive definitions and proofs offered by Coq, and show that it facilitates the discovery and the presentation of the results.}

Typical examples are XML query languages that allow selection of subdocuments without exhaustively specifying intermediate element tags. Other examples are languages and libraries for polytypic or strategic functional programming and for adaptive object-oriented programming.In this paper, we present an algebraic approach to transformation of declarative structure-shy programs, in particular for strategic functions and XML queries. We formulate a rich set of algebraic laws, not just for transformation of structure-shy programs, but also for their conversion into structure-sensitive programs and vice versa. We show how subsets of these laws can be used to construct effective rewrite systems for specialization, generalization, and optimization of structure-shy programs. We present a type-safe encoding of these rewrite systems in Haskell which itself uses strategic functional programming techniques.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Partial Evaluation and Semantics-Based Program Manipulation}, pages = {11–20}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {point-free program calculation, XML query languages, algebraic program transformation, type specialization, strategic functional programming, type generalization}, location = {Nice, France}, series = {PEPM '07} }

Rust aims to be a systems language that competes with C/C++. A claimed advantage of Rust is a strong focus on memory safety without garbage collection. This is primarily achieved through two concepts, namely, reference lifetimes and borrowing. Both of these are well-known ideas stemming from the literature on region-based memory management and linearity/uniqueness. Rust brings both of these ideas together to form a coherent programming model. Furthermore, Rust has a strong focus on stack-allocated data and, like C/C++ but unlike Java, permits references to local variables.Type checking in Rust can be viewed as a two-phase process: First, a traditional type checker operates in a flow-insensitive fashion; second, a borrow checker enforces an ownership invariant using a flow-sensitive analysis. In this article, we present a lightweight formalism that captures these two phases using a flow-sensitive type system that enforces “type and borrow safety.” In particular, programs that are type and borrow safe will not attempt to dereference dangling pointers. Our calculus core captures many aspects of Rust, including copy- and move-semantics, mutable borrowing, reborrowing, partial moves, and lifetimes. In particular, it remains sufficiently lightweight to be easily digested and understood and, we argue, still captures the salient aspects of reference lifetimes and borrowing. Furthermore, extensions to the core can easily add more complex features (e.g., control-flow, tuples, method invocation). We provide a soundness proof to verify our key claims of the calculus. We also provide a reference implementation in Java with which we have model checked our calculus using over 500B input programs. We have also fuzz tested the Rust compiler using our calculus against 2B programs and, to date, found one confirmed compiler bug and several other possible issues.}, journal = {ACM Trans. Program.
